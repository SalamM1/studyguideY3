# Study Guide 2019-20
A study guide document compiling the basics from each course I studied in Year 3 CS.  
The study guide is written in LaTeX by student Faisal Alrajhi.  
This is not an official guide and has no direct relation to the School of Computer Science or University of Birmingham; it is made by me to study for my exams and should not be used as anything more than supplementary study material to the respective exams.
